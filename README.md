## <a name="tech-stack">⚙️ Tech Stack</a>

- **[Expo](https://expo.dev/)** – The all-in-one platform for developing and deploying cross-platform React Native apps, featuring fast refresh, OTA updates, and file-based routing via Expo Router.

- **[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)** – The framework powering the app’s cross-platform UI, enabling rich, native-feeling experiences built entirely in JavaScript/TypeScript.

- **[Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/)** – An open-source backend platform providing authentication, databases, storage, and serverless functions — all through a clean, developer-friendly API.

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** – Ensures type safety and maintainable code, improving reliability and scalability throughout the project.

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** with **[NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/)** – Enables utility-first styling for React Native components, delivering consistent, responsive, and elegant UI designs rapidly.

- **[Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)** is a minimal, hook-based state management library for React and React Native. It lets you manage global state with zero boilerplate, no context providers, and excellent performance through selective state subscriptions.

- **[Sentry](https://jsm.dev/rn-food-sentry)** is a powerful error tracking and performance monitoring tool for React Native apps. It helps you detect, diagnose, and fix issues in real-time to improve app stability and user experience.
